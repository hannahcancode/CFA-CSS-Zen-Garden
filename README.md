# CSS Zen Garden

[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a project that aims to demonstrate what can be achieved using CSS for visual design.

This depository holds a css stylesheet that I have created to display the default CSS Zen Garden html, without modifying the html itself.

This design features:

* a strong heading
* fixed background images that alternate as you scroll down the page, emphasising the movement between sections
* fonts imported live from Google fonts

Images have all been released into the Public Domain by their original creators, and were obtained from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).
